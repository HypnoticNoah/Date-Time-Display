# Date-Time-Display Infomration 
This is a simple script that uses jquery, JavaScript, an a live clock API. It gives a list of buttons and depending on what you click you will receive your current date or current time, also it displays a live clock of the CST (Centra Stand Time) time zone. It also includes a cool effect of confetti which slowly goes away.
